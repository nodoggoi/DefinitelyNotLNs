                New Transfer Student’s Little<br>
                Sister, We Gradually Grew<br> 
                Closer</p>
            <p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: 375;">One day, a beautiful girl like a story - Charlotte Bennett - came to study<br> 
                abroad in Akito's class. He is attracted to her elegant appearance and cute<br>
                appearance that everyone is fascinated by, but Akito gives up even approaching<br> 
                her because she is out of reach. However, after saving Charlotte's sister, who<br>
                was lost, the Bennett sisters began to come to Akito's room every day. As they<br>
                spend more time together and become attracted to each other, they eventually<br>
                lead a sweet, jittery, sugary life.</p>
