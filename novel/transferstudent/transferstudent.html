            <span> One day, a beautiful girl like a story - Charlotte Bennett - came to study abroad in Akito's class. He is attracted to her elegant appearance and cute appearance that everyone is fascinated by, but Akito gives up even approaching her because she is out of reach. However, after saving Charlotte's sister, who was lost, the Bennett sisters began to come to Akito's room every day. As they spend more time together and become attracted to each other, they eventually lead a sweet, jittery, sugary life. </span>
